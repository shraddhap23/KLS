       <h5>Meet Daniel - One of our first customers to be brave enough to seek help in his transformation when he moved from the rough and tumble of Queens to the actual Village of Queens, West Village. For Daniel, we used hair extensions and an array of beauty products for his face. While we worked on his face we taught him how to recreate this look at home. Though he usually does himself up now, for big events such as paegents and shows we're still his number one pick!</h5>

      <h5>Meet Ricky - Before we met him, his name was Ricardo. Enough said. Kidding, Ricky is our most famous customer, most of you may know him for his music but before his makeover he was just a cook for Staten Island High School. Makeup was a new concept to him but we helped him figure his way around with teaching him how to apply foundation and taming his full head of hair and look at him now!</h5>
